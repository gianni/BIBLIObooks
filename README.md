# BIBLIObooks

The "BIBLIObooks" is a distributed system consisting of two Laravel projects deployed in separate containers.
Each project represents an independent instance of a library, allowing users to query the catalog and reserve books for a specific period.
The communication between the two systems is facilitated through a RESTful API.
